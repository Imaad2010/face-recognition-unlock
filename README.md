# üîì Face Recognition Unlock System using Jetson Nano

This project is a real-time face recognition‚Äìbased smart unlocking system using **Jetson Nano**, **OpenCV**, **UDP broadcasting**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**. The system can be used to unlock doors or gates wirelessly when an authorized face is detected.

---

## üéØ What It Does

- Detects known faces using a connected camera (real-time)
- Requires the face to stay in view for at least **2 seconds** to confirm
- Announces the person‚Äôs name and confidence via speaker
- Sends a **UDP broadcast** to trigger an external gate or door unlock
- Logs every unlock attempt with timestamps

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- face_recognition
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- UDP Sockets
- Jetson Nano (hardware platform)
